## PURPOSE OF THIS NOTICE

This notice follows the formal public notice issued on May 8, 2025, titled **"Notice of Unclaimed Goods and Opportunity to Cure."** The subject party, Mr. Zig Ziegler, was notified of a confirmed production completion and given an opportunity to claim goods, settle the outstanding balance, or submit a counterproposal by May 9, 2025.

No payment, claim, or formal settlement proposal was received by the deadline. Although the goods became eligible for abandonment as of May 12, 2025, AW3 Consulting, LLC withheld publication of the final notice to allow for any last-minute resolution.

On **May 25, 2025**, Mr. Ziegler issued a formal legal notice asserting a cease-and-desist position. On **May 27, 2025**, Mr. Ziegler terminated communication, rejected all resolution options, and declined to claim the goods. This confirms the abandonment status as **final and irreversible**.
